### Tools / Howtos that can be useful for other people:
- [scraper-and-analyser](): COMING SOON! My tools for web scraping, extracting relevant data and then running analyses. I use it primarily for job search however it can be used in any use case which involves running searches on multiple websites and analysing results.
- [mitmproxy to sniff apps on your PC]: A very old article which doesn't read too well üòÖBasically you need another computer / VM / container to MITM HTTPS communication created by processes running on your Linux box. (You also need the certs obviously üòÅ.) However you can use `cgroups` directly which is arguably more straight-forward. Mainly useful for testing network related software.
- [cv-template](https://github.com/aciliketcap/cv-template): CV-as-code written in TeX. I find it easier to manage multiple versions of a doc at the same time in Git.
### Various code assignments from old interviews
I change the premise a little bit in most cases so that they're not exactly the same.
- [smart-fridge-events]() : COMING SOON! Service which reads a binary event log and publishes events of it's own according to given rules.
	- I'm also working on another version where binary file handling is done in Rust. I'll connect it to the main module via [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3)
- [quartet](): COMING SOON! Quartet game implementation but it's just code that plays on it's own.
- [terraform-lambda-example](): COMING SOON! A simple Lambda and accompanying stuff defined in Terraform.
### Programming languages:
- [C Must Retire!](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/c-must-retire-sinan-akpolat/) An article I wrote back in 2017 about moving to C alternatives (Go, modern C++, Swift and, Rust). It was more of a rant but we can see the sentiment was shared across many other developers. I moved on to other areas and didn't come back to Rust until 2025.
	- And [this is a comment](https://medium.com/@aciliketcap/like-some-other-people-who-commented-i-think-that-the-correct-thing-to-do-is-to-look-for-45d8fbaec4bb) to someone else's article (possible behind a paywall) which serves as kind of an update.
- [C# delegates and events](https://medium.com/@aciliketcap/c-delegates-and-events-baf4d48f84a): Old article explaining delegates and event handlers in C# and how they relate to Strategy and Observer patterns.
- I'll write and add more programming languages related articles and put links here.
### Old Qt stuff:
- [cropper](https://github.com/aciliketcap/cropper): Simple image cropper
- [zlqt](https://github.com/aciliketcap/zlqt): Single page UI which translates command line parameters for a game into a visual menu
### Old kernel / systems related:
I want to get back to ez8139 and fakearp some time and make them more functional. However I haven't touched them in 10 years so no big chance.
- [Kernel Development Articles](https://medium.com/@aciliketcap/reviving-kernel-development-articles-from-2014-intro-be61a1646f35): Articles about Linux kernel module development by using QEMU VMs.
- [qemu-scripts](https://github.com/aciliketcap/qemu-scripts): Simple scripts to launch and configure QEMU VM instances for kernel development purposes
- [fakearp](https://github.com/aciliketcap/fakearp) : Educational, how to create a basic Linux eth driver. Creates a fake interface which responds to ARP requests. 
- [ez8139](https://github.com/aciliketcap/ez8139) : rtl8139 driver for educational purposes. It is kept simple to work only in x86_64 QEMU VMs with most features not implemented. Actually not even packet transfers were implemented AFAIRüòÖ
- [scully](https://github.com/aciliketcap/scully): "Hello, world!" char driver for Linux kernel
- [conchat](https://github.com/aciliketcap/conchat): Multi-threaded server and client with UNIX sockets and pthreads. Kind of like a chat server. Again, just educational.
